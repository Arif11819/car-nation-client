                I have been interested in tech and coding from an early age. My first exposure to programming logic came from sandbox video games like Minecraft and LittleBigPlanet when I was 10. I made modular analog clocks, complex vault doors, top-down arcade games, and more! <br /><br />

                Now I'm a  Frontend Developer who codes with React and RESTful APIs, hoping it helps and improves people's lives. The positive effects of the applications and websites I build are what motivate me to keep learning, developing, and iterating. <br /><br />

                I like to connect with people and share ideas, so feel free to reach out at
